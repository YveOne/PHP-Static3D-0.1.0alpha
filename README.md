# PHP-Static3D-0.1.0alpha

In normal cases PHP runs in just one single thread. Thats why a 3D rendering engine could be useless.
Well, this project is not to replace the wheel by an new and better one
but to understand the basics of 3d rendering.

Static3D can't render opaque textures or reflections!
Static3D can't work with meshes (yet)!
Static3D also doesn't use tesseleration (yet)!
But: Static3D can render ONE (in number: 1) frame pretty fast considering it's all running in one thread :)
